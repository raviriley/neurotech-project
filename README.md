# neurotech project

## Initial Setup

### Python & Poetry

We're currently using Python 3.10.
We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for Python dependency management.
Ensure you have Python 3.10.\* installed and set up, along with Poetry.
Click [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for Poetry installation instructions.

### Getting Started

The first thing you should do after cloning this repo is install the Poetry dependencies by running `poetry install`.
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can now spawn a virtualenv shell by running `poetry shell`.
Whenever working on the project you should always use the `poetry shell`.

Ensure that you pick the newly created poetry virtual env for your notebook's kernel.
